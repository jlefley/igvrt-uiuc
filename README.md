  - Very basic machine autonomy (line detection, obstacle avoidance and other computer vision)
  - Arduino interfacing for sensors
  - Roboteq AX2550 serial interfacing
  
Previously hosted at [Google code](http://code.google.com/p/igvrt-uiuc/)  Prior to Google code, the project was hosted elsewhere; the commit history from there has been lost.  Much of the original code was authored by Josh Sulkin.
